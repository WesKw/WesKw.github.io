        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Like anyone else, Deaf adults often find themselves looking for a place to eat at many different points during the day. However, it’s hard for them to find
            restaurants that can accommodate their needs. Deaf adults may find it difficult to communicate with servers that speak too quickly. They also might find it 
            difficult to order at restaurants that don’t have a way to order online or through a kiosk. Some Deaf adults also find it frustrating when missing callouts 
            for a table that they are waiting for. Other Deaf adults want to foster a community that they can eat and converse with. Our solution, SignDine, proposes a 
            way to improve the experience of eating out for Deaf adults by allowing them to find restaurants that cater to their needs, or improving the existing dining 
            experience at restaurants that may not cater to all of their needs. Our solution aims to improve their dining experience by highlighting restaurants with sign 
            language proficient staff, visual menus, and other accessibility features. By providing accessible dining options, we aim to empower the deaf community and 
            encourage restaurants to be more inclusive. The app will not only enhance the social and dining experience for deaf individuals but also promote greater awareness 
            and accessibility in the hospitality industry.</p>

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <h3>Requirements Gathering</h3>
        <p>
            For requirements gathering, we employed a semi-structured interview process to gather information from Deaf adults. In each interview, we asked questions about
            restaurant experiences as someone in the Deaf community, good vs bad experiences, what Deaf adults look for and avoid in restaurants, current tools (phone applications)
            that they use when dining out, and their likes and dislikes about each tool.
        </p>
        <h3>Preliminary and Detailed Design</h3>
        <p>
            For the preliminary and detailed design phase, we created tasks and sketches for each task from the results of the requirements gathering. After revising and evaluating
            our sketches, we created a low-fidelity prototype using the best sketches, and used a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate the effectiveness.
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            Once our cognitive walkthrough was finished, we used the feedback from it to revise our low-fidelity prototype and implement our final prototype.
        </p>
        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
        <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
        <p>Our final prototype was implemented using React Native. We primarily wrote and tested our final prototype as an Android application.</p>
        <p>
            A key aspect of SignDine for our target users is that it's easy and quick to use. Through our studies we've found that Deaf adults prefer to use their
            phones as little as possible when dining out. As such, we want our solution to have high learnability while also being simple to use. To create this simple
            to use interface, we used icon mappings to clearly map each part of the navigation bar to functionality.
