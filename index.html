        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>Like anyone else, Deaf adults often find themselves looking for a place to eat at many different points during the day. However, it’s hard for them to find
            restaurants that can accommodate their needs. Deaf adults may find it difficult to communicate with servers that speak too quickly. They also might find it difficult to order at restaurants that don’t have a way to order online or through a kiosk. Some Deaf adults also find it frustrating when missing callouts for a table that they are waiting for. Other Deaf adults want to foster a community that they can eat and converse with. Our solution, SignDine, proposes a way to improve the experience of eating out for Deaf adults by allowing them to find restaurants that cater to their needs, or improving the existing dining experience at restaurants that may not cater to all of their needs. Our solution aims to improve their dining experience by highlighting restaurants with sign language proficient staff, visual menus, and other accessibility features. By providing accessible dining options, we aim to empower the deaf community and encourage restaurants to be more inclusive. The app will not only enhance the social and dining experience for deaf individuals but also promote greater awareness and accessibility in the hospitality industry.</p>
