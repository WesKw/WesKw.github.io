        <h2>Background</h2>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
            Like anyone else, Deaf adults often find themselves looking for a place to eat at many different points during the day. However, it’s hard for them to find
            restaurants that can accommodate their needs. Deaf adults may find it difficult to communicate with servers that speak too quickly. They also might find it 
            difficult to order at restaurants that don’t have a way to order online or through a kiosk. Some Deaf adults also find it frustrating when missing callouts 
            for a table that they are waiting for. Other Deaf adults want to foster a community that they can eat and converse with. Our solution, SignDine, proposes a 
            way to improve the experience of eating out for Deaf adults by allowing them to find restaurants that cater to their needs, or improving the existing dining 
            experience at restaurants that may not cater to all of their needs. Our solution aims to improve their dining experience by highlighting restaurants with sign 
            language proficient staff, visual menus, and other accessibility features. By providing accessible dining options, we aim to empower the deaf community and 
            encourage restaurants to be more inclusive. The app will not only enhance the social and dining experience for deaf individuals but also promote greater awareness 
            and accessibility in the hospitality industry.

        <h2>Process</h2>
        <img id="design" class="design-image" src="images/designthinking_illustration_final2-02.png" alt="Design Thinking Illustration">
        <h3>Requirements Gathering - Empathize and Define</h3>
        <p>
            For requirements gathering, we employed a semi-structured interview process to gather information from Deaf adults. In each interview, we asked questions about
            restaurant experiences as someone in the Deaf community, good vs bad experiences, what Deaf adults look for and avoid in restaurants, current tools (phone applications)
            that they use when dining out, and their likes and dislikes about each tool. From this, we developed our user, functional, environmental, and usability requirements.
        </p>
        <h3>Preliminary and Detailed Design - Ideate, Prototype, Test</h3>
        <p>
            For the preliminary and detailed design phase, we created tasks and sketches for each task from the results of the requirements gathering. After revising and evaluating
            our sketches, we created a low-fidelity prototype using the best sketches, and used a cognitive walkthrough to evaluate the effectiveness.
        </p>
        <h3>Implementation</h3>
        <p>
            Once our cognitive walkthrough was finished, we used the feedback from it to revise our low-fidelity prototype and implement our final prototype.
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
        <h3>Tech Stack</h3>
        <p>Our final prototype was implemented using React Native. We primarily wrote and tested our final prototype as an Android application.</p>
        <p>
            A key aspect of SignDine for our target users is that it's easy and quick to use. Through our studies we've found that Deaf adults prefer to use their
            phones as little as possible when dining out. As such, we want our solution to have high learnability while also being simple to use. To create this simple
            to use interface, we used icon mappings to clearly map each part of the navigation bar to functionality.

                The home page features a search bar and an interactive map. When users search for a restaurant, the map dynamically
                    pans and zooms to the restaurant’s location, highlighted by a marker. The restaurant’s name, rating, and the number
                    of Deaf individuals dining there are displayed below the map.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most important user goals was to be able to foster a sense of community when going out to eat.
                So, tapping the group icon on the restaurant card opens a modal pop-up with details such as age and occupation 
                of the Deaf individuals present, promoting social inclusion. Users can also interact with the map directly,
                ensuring user control and flexibility.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our interview participants also expressed a desired to avoid spending too much time on their phone. So, we wanted our 
                application to be as easy to learn as possible. To do this, we used clear mappings from icons to functionality.

            <p>
                The microphone page enables users to listen for their order number or table callout in a restaurant. The “Start Listening” button activates a virtual microphone to detect audio cues for the entered order number. When listening, the status changes dynamically, providing real-time feedback via visual indicators such as a green status bar and an animated microphone icon, which creates a perception of active listening.
            </p>
            <p>
                The timer functionality ensures users know how long the system will listen, providing user control and predictability. Additionally, features like the vibration toggle (to enable haptic feedback) and the auto-reminder allow the user to customize how they wish to be notified, supporting user personalization.

                The review page enables users to search for recently visited restaurants, view details such as the location, image, and the visit date, and then provide feedback. When a restaurant is selected, users are presented with a review form that includes a rating system for categories like “Staff Friendliness” and “Ease of Ordering.”The interactive star-based rating system, enhanced with hover animations, ensures natural mapping, offering a clear and intuitive input mechanism. This keeps the interface easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The comment box allows users to provide additional textual feedback, offering flexibility in expressing their opinions. After submission, the app displays a confirmation message and marks the restaurant as “Reviewed,” using recognition over recall to visually indicate completed tasks. Users can also edit previously submitted reviews, ensuring user freedom and the ability to refine their feedback.

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        <h3>Design Cycle</h3>
        <p>
            Ideally, we would do another iteration of the design process, using the functional prototype to gather feedback
            from our userbase about the existing features of our prototype.
        </p>
        <h3>Restaurant Search</h3>
        <p>
            Currently the restaurant search uses a sample database to pull data from. If this application was going to be fully functional,
            the restaurant search function would use a combination of pulling data from google as well as an internal database to store
            reviews. We also wanted to link the search function directly to the review page and vice-versa, so that the user only needed to
            search once, either on the review page or the search page.
        </p>
        <h3>Reviews</h3>
        <p>
            Each restaurant in the reviews section does not use the internal database to pull and store data from. It uses placeholder restaurants
            instead of pulling from the database. In the future, all pages in the application will pull and store data using the internal database.
        </p>
        <h3>Microphone</h3>
        <p>
            The microphone features is the feature that is the least developed. In the future, we would want the microphone tool to be able
            to detect voice input.
